Welcome to CloudTower API! Please read this General Guide carefully.
* You can use the CloudTower API to call the different types of resources that are managed by CloudTower.
* This document is written following the OpenApi Specification v3.0.0.
* To enhance ease of use, the API documentation is split into multiple modules, which can be selected from the left sidebar under the CloudTower API page, such as Virtual Machine Management and Cluster Management.
* The CloudTower API provides very flexible request parameter types, which are convenient for batch operations and conditional queries. Considering the flexibility of parameters and the convenience of usage, such as the `GET` request has some restrictions, this API document only uses the `POST` request to send data in json format.
